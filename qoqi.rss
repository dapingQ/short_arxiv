      <title>Demonstration of Quantum Polarization Microscopy using an Entangled-Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of non-classical light sources such as single-photon and entangled-photon sources, innovative microscopy based on the quantum principles has been proposed over traditional microscopy. This paper introduces the experimental demonstration of a quantum polarization microscopic technique that incorporates a quantum-entangled photon source. Although the point that employs the variation of polarization angle due to reflection or transmission at the sample is similar to classical polarization microscopy, the method for constructing image contrast is significantly different. Image contrast is constructed by the coincidence count of signal and idler photons. In the case that coincidence count is recorded from both the signal and idler photons, the photon statistics resemble a thermal state, similar to the blackbody radiation, but with a significantly higher peak intensity in the second order autocorrelation function at zero delay that is derived from coincidence count. While, when the coincidence count is taken from either the signal or idler photon only, though the photon state exhibits a thermal state again, the photon statistics become more dispersive and result in a lower peak intensity of the autocorrelation function. These different thermal states can be switched by slightly changing the photon polarization, which is suddenly aroused within narrow range of analyzer angle. This polarization microscopic technique can provide a superior imaging technique compared to the classical method, opening a new frontier for research in material sciences, biology, and other fields requiring high-resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Highly sensitive temperature sensing via quadratic optomechanical coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of scanning quantum microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging is an ever expanding research field, in which the aim is to exploit the quantum nature of light to enhance image reconstruction capabilities. Despite a number of successful demonstrations for quantum imaging, quantum microscopy still seems out of the range for practical applications, due to different physical and technical reasons. Here we propose an imaging method exploiting the quantum correlations of photon pairs and a scanning microscope to achieve fast, single mode quantum imaging. We first test our technique on a metal grating to estimate the resolution capabilities of our system. Moreover, we asses its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way towards scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications. Our results, combined with the rapidly evolving photon-pair generation and detection technology towards the mid-infrared, could lead to an extension of quantum microscopy applications towards the mid-infrared, to access the molecular fingerprint region.</description>
