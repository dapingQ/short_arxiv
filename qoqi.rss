      <title>Supersymmetry in nonlinear and linear Quantum Optics: the Kerr-like and multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to analyze a rather vast counter-rotating Hamiltonian interaction in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. The method relies upon the supersymmetric mapping of the corresponding rotating interaction and allows the analysis of the dynamics in the counter-rotating system in a fully general and exact analytical manner. Intriguing features of the counter-rotating system are revealed through the simple supersymmetric transformation. In turn, such interesting attributes have an important range of potential technological applications. In this way, supersymmetry emerges as a useful tool to both connect and construct exactly solvable photonic systems in cavity quantum electrodynamics, and more generally in quantum optics, as well as to analyze the corresponding physical consequences and their possible technology implementations.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Hong-Ou-Mandel interference with Structured Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect, an effective two-photon interference phenomenon, is a cornerstone of quantum optics and a key tool for linear optical quantum information processing. While the HOM effect has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally for various photonic quantum states, particularly in the spectral domain, detailed overviews of its behaviour for structured photons -- those with complex spatial profiles -- under arbitrary spatial mode measurement schemes are still lacking. This tutorial aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the HOM effect for structured photons, including an arbitrary mode projection on quantum interference outcomes. The tutorial also provides analytical, closed-form expressions of the HOM visibility under different measurement conditions, which is a crucial contribution for its application in computational and artificial-intelligence-driven discovery of new quantum experiments exploiting the power of photons with complex spatial modes.</description>

      <title>Origin of performance enhancement of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors by He-ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.</description>

      <title>On-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing light from solid-state single-photon sources with scalable and robust room-temperature quantum memories has been a long-standing challenge in photonic quantum information technologies due to inherent noise processes and time-scale mismatches between the operating conditions of solid-state and atomic systems. Here, we demonstrate on-demand storage and retrieval of single photons from a semiconductor quantum dot device in a room-temperature atomic vapor memory. A deterministically fabricated InGaAs quantum dot light source emits single photons at the wavelength of the cesium D1 line at 895\,nm which exhibit an inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of 5.1(7)\,GHz and are subsequently stored in a low-noise ladder-type cesium vapor memory. We show control over the interaction between the single photons and the atomic vapor, allowing for variable retrieval times of up to 19.8(3)\,ns at an internal efficiency of $\eta_\mathrm{int}=0.6(1)\%$. Our results significantly expand the application space of both room-temperature vapor memories and semiconductor quantum dots in future quantum network architectures.</description>

      <title>Hybrid integrated ultra-low linewidth coil stabilized isolator-free widely tunable external cavity laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision applications such as quantum computing, quantum and fiber sensing, and mmWave and RF generation, require ultra-low phase noise stabilized lasers operating at wavelengths across the visible to near-IR. These applications employ widely tunable table-scale laser systems, bulk-optic reference cavities, and optical isolation to achieve ultra-low frequency noise and high stability across wide wavelength ranges. Photonic integration promises to bring these laser systems to the chip-scale, enabling reliable, scalable and portable precision applications. Here we report record-low integrated laser linewidths with a coil-cavity stabilized 1550 nm tunable laser, that achieves 3 to 7 Hz fundamental linewidth across a 60 nm tuning range and 27 - 60 Hz integral linewidths with an Allan deviation of 1.8E-13 at 6.4 ms across 40 nm. These results represent 5 orders of magnitude noise reduction and almost 2-orders magnitude reduction in integral linewidth for widely tunable integrated lasers. The hybrid integrated silicon nitride external cavity tunable laser is stabilized to a silicon nitride 10-meter long integrated coil-resonator without the need for an optical isolator by leveraging the inherent 45 dB isolation. The laser and reference cavity are fabricated in the same 80 nm-thick ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguide CMOS foundry compatible process, which combined with the inherent isolation, unlocks the path towards fully integrated visible to NIR frequency-stabilized lasers.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Gauge Field for Ultracold Atoms Induced by Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector beams (VBs) with spatially varying polarization have broad applications across various fields of optics. We introduce a novel use of VBs to generate synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms. By leveraging VBs' rich tunability, this scheme enables the emergence of angular stripe phases over a significantly expanded parameter range, achieving a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and thereby making experimental observation feasible. It also allows for the creation of topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology controlled by VB parameters and without requiring rotation. Our work opens new avenues for utilizing VBs in quantum control of ultracold atoms and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Velocity-comb modulation transfer spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-Doppler laser spectroscopy is a crucial technique for laser frequency stabilization, playing a significant role in atomic physics, precision measurement, and quantum communication. However, recent efforts to improve frequency stability appear to have reached a bottleneck, as they primarily focus on external technical approaches while neglecting the fundamental issue of low atomic utilization (&lt; 1%), caused by only near-zero transverse velocity atoms involved in the transition. Here, we propose a velocity-comb modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) solution that takes advantage of the velocity-selective resonance effect of multi-frequency comb lasers to enhance the utilization of non-zero-velocity atoms. In the probe-pump configuration, each pair of counter-propagating lasers interacts with atoms from different transverse velocity-comb groups, independently contributing to the spectral amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio. Preliminary proof-of-principle results show that the frequency stability of the triple-frequency laser is optimized by nearly a factor of \sqrt{3} compared to the single-frequency laser, consistent with theoretical expectations. With more frequency comb components, MTS-stabilized lasers are expected to achieve order-of-magnitude breakthroughs in frequency stability, taking an important step toward next-generation compact optical clocks. This unique method can also be widely applied to any quantum system with a wide velocity distribution, inspiring innovative advances in numerous fields with a fresh perspective.</description>
