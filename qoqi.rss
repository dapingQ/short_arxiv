      <title>Tunable quantum light by modulated free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of light are fundamental in various applications, spanning quantum computation to enhanced sensing. Fast free electrons, which emit light into photonic structures through the mechanism of spontaneous emission, represent a promising platform for generating diverse types of states. Indeed, the intrinsic connection between the input electron wave function and the output light field suggests that electron-shaping schemes, based on light-induced scattering, facilitates their synthesis. In this article, we present a theoretical framework capable of predicting the final optical density matrix of a generic N-electron state that can also account for post-sample energy filtering. By using such framework, we study the modulation-dependent fluctuations of the N-electron emission and identify regions of Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. In the single-electron case, we show how coherent states with nearly 90% purity can be formed by pre-filtering a portion of the spectrum after modulation, and how non-Gaussian states are generated after a precise energy measurement. Furthermore, we present a strategy combining a single-stage electron modulation and post-filtering to harness tailored light states, such as squeezed vacuum, cat, and triangular cat states, with fidelity close to 100%.</description>

      <title>Electron dynamics induced by quantum cat-state light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an effective theory for describing electron dynamics driven by an optical external field in a Schr\"{o}dinger's cat state. We show that the electron density matrix evolves as an average over trajectories $\{\rho_\alpha\}$ weighted by the Sudarshan--Glauber $P$ distribution $P(\alpha)$ in the weak light--matter coupling regime. Each trajectory obeys an equation of motion, $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho_\alpha=\mathcal{H}_{\alpha} \rho_\alpha-\rho_\alpha\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$, where an effective Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}$ becomes non-Hermitian due to quantum interference of light. The optical quantum interference is transferred to electrons through the asymmetric action between the ket and bra state vectors in $\rho_{\alpha}$. This non-Hermitian dynamics differs from the conventional one observed in open quantum systems, described by $\mathrm{i} \partial_t\rho=\mathcal{H}\rho-\rho \mathcal{H}^\dagger$, which has complex conjugation in the second term. We confirm that the results of the effective theory agree with those of full electron--photon system simulations for the few-electron Dicke model, demonstrating experimental accessibility to exotic non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-photon interference between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals scattered off a semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative linewidth of a two-level emitter (TLE) ultimately determines the bandwidth it can offer for quantum information processing. However, no prior experiment has so far been performed to examine the effect of driving detuning on indistinguishability of photons scattered off a TLE, a parameter that is crucial for photonic quantum computing. Here, we perform post-selective two-photon interference experiments between mutually-detuned resonance fluorescence signals from an InAs quantum dot embedded in a micropillar cavity. Our results suggest that indistinguishability among photons scattered off a quantum dot is inherently insensitive to the driving laser's detuning, as straightforwardly predicted by the resonance fluorescence model that systematically treats all scattered photons as spontaneous emission.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with trivial band topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive quantum geometric bounds in spinful systems with spin-topology characterized by a single $\mathbb{Z}$-index protected by a spin gap. Our bounds provide geometric conditions on the spin topology, distinct from the known quantum geometric bounds associated with Wilson loops and nontrivial band topologies. As a result, we obtain stricter bounds in time-reversal symmetric systems with a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index and also bounds in systems with a trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, where quantum metric should be otherwise unbounded. We benchmark these findings with first-principles calculations in elemental Bismuth realizing higher even nontrivial spin-Chern numbers. Moreover, we connect these bounds to optical responses, demonstrating that spin-resolved quantum geometry can be observed experimentally. Finally, we connect spin-bounds to quantum Fisher information and Cram\'er-Rao bounds which are central to quantum metrology, showing that the elemental Bi and other spin-topological phases hold promises for topological free fermion quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Bi-self-trapping of excitons via the long-living phonon mode and their superfluorescent markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of the system response offers guidance for designing single-component material devices with required properties. A notable phenomenon of room-temperature superfluorescence recently observed in hybrid perovskites at high concentrations of excitations lacks of comprehensive theoretical framework. Addressing this gap necessitates a discussion grounded in non-linear and multiparticle theories. In this study, we offer the two-step mechanism: formation of two self-trapped excitons entangled via the same long-living phonon mode, and their rearrangement into a superradiating mirror symmetric configuration. Based on the semiclassical equations of motion we examine the criteria for the high-temperature self-trapping and bi-self trapping of excitons. Our findings indicate that the self-trapped excitons are described by the stable phase-locked steadystate solution of the equations of motion, and at elevated exciton concentrations, they compete with the bi-self-trapped excitons. The latter is described by the Dicke model and is thus responsible for the generation of the superfluorescent spectral peak. The obtained theoretical spectra are in good agreement with the experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Generation of Deep Ultraviolet Optical Vortices via Amplitude and Phase Spiral Zone Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development and experimental implementation of diffractive optical elements designed to generate optical vortices in the deep ultraviolet range (from 260 to 266 nm). These elements, fabricated using advanced lithographic and etching techniques, facilitate the efficient transformation of Gaussian beams into twisted modes carrying orbital angular momentum. Experimental tests conducted using the laser driver of an RF photoinjector at JINR successfully demonstrate the generation of deep-ultraviolet optical vortices with a topological charge of l = 1. These findings underscore the potential of structured light in the deep ultraviolet range for applications in relativistic electron beam studies and beam manipulation technologies.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>
