      <title>Stabilizing an optical cavity containing a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We successfully stabilized a Fabry-P\'erot optical cavity incorporating a bulk diamond crystal at millikelvin temperatures in a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator with the pulse-tube cryocooler running. In stark contrast to previous demonstrations where lasers were locked to the cavities, our setup locks the cavity to a laser. Our measurements of cavity length fluctuation suggest that the setup could stabilize a cavity up to a finesse of $1.2\times 10^4$ without the diamond and $5.8 \times10^3$ with the diamond crystal. The finesse with a diamond crystal of approximately 90 is primarily limited by the absorption loss inside the diamond.</description>

      <title>Addressing the correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In resonance fluorescence excitation experiments, light emitted from solid-state quantum emitters is typically filtered to eliminate the laser photons, ensuring that only red-shifted Stokes photons are detected. Theoretical analyses of the fluorescence intensity correlation often model emitters as two-level systems, focusing on light emitted exclusively from the purely electronic transition (the Zero-Phonon Line), or rely on statistical approaches based on conditional probabilities that do not account for quantum coherences. Here, we propose a general model to characterize the correlation of either Zero-Phonon Line photons or Stokes-shifted photons. This model successfully reproduces the experimental correlation of Stokes-shifted photons emitted from two interacting molecules and predicts that this correlation is affected by quantum coherence. Besides, we analyze the role of quantum coherence in light emission from two uncorrelated emitters, which helps to clarify the discrepancy between theory and experiments regarding the value of the correlation of photons emitted from this system at zero delay time.</description>

      <title>Programmable Synthetic Magnetism and Chiral Edge States in Nano-Optomechanical Quantum Hall Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial magnetic fields break time-reversal symmetry in engineered materials--also known as metamaterials, enabling robust, topological transport of neutral excitations, much like electronic conduction edge channels in the integer quantum Hall effect. We experimentally demonstrate the emergence of quantum-Hall-like chiral edge states in optomechanical resonator networks. Synthetic magnetic fields for phononic excitations are induced through laser drives, while cavity optomechanical control allows full reconfigurability of the effective metamaterial response of the networks, including programming of magnetic fluxes in multiple resonator plaquettes. By tuning the interplay between network connectivity and magnetic fields, we demonstrate both flux-sensitive and flux-insensitive localized mechanical states. Scaling up the system creates spectral features that are precursors to Hofstadter butterfly spectra. Site-resolved spectroscopy reveals edge-bulk separation, with stationary phononic distributions signaling chiral edge modes. We directly probe those edge modes in transport measurements to demonstrate a unidirectional acoustic channel. This work unlocks new ways of controlling topological phononic phases at the nanoscale with applications in noise management and information processing.</description>
