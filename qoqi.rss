      <title>A simple model for entangled photon generation in resonant structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to engineer pairs of entangled photons is essential to quantum information science, and generating these states using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in nano- and micrometer-scale materials offers numerous advantages. To properly engineer such sources, a reliable model describing nano- and micrometer-scale SPDC is necessary; however, such a theoretical description remains a challenge. Here, we propose a simplified model to describe SPDC in resonant structures, which considers the generation of photon pairs and the resonant enhancement of spectral bands to be separate processes, even though they actually occur simultaneously. We compare our simplified model to both the rigorous theory of SPDC in an etalon - a simple example of a resonant structure - and our experiments on SPDC in etalons and find agreement for low-gain SPDC. By simplifying the calculations required to generate photon pairs, our model promises to make designing complex resonant structures easier, and it promises to hasten the iteration of designs across the field of quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Center Infrastructures: A Scalable Architectural Design Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of scalable quantum networks that utilize optical switches to interconnect multiple quantum processors, facilitating large-scale quantum computing. By leveraging these novel architectures, we aim to address the limitations of current quantum processors and explore the potential of quantum data centers. We provide an in-depth analysis of these architectures through the development of simulation tools and performance metrics, offering a detailed comparison of their advantages and trade-offs. We hope this work serves as a foundation for the development of efficient and resilient quantum networks, designed to meet the evolving demands of future quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Supercharging Single-Atom Traps by Collisional Blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the surface paradox: Buried perovskite quantum dots in wide-bandgap perovskite thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are an exciting platform for on-demand quantum, and classical optoelectronic and photonic devices. However, their potential success is limited by the extreme sensitivity and low stability arising from their weak intrinsic lattice bond energy and complex surface chemistry. Here we report a novel platform of buried perovskite quantum dots (b-PQDs) in a three-dimensional perovskite thin-film, fabricated using one-step, flash annealing, which overcomes surface related instabilities in colloidal perovskite dots. The b-PQDs demonstrate ultrabright and stable single-dot emission, with resolution-limited linewidths below 130 {\mu}eV, photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.1), no blinking, suppressed spectral diffusion, and high photon count rates of 10^4/s, consistent with unity quantum yield. The ultrasharp linewidth resolves exciton fine-structures (dark and triplet excitons) and their dynamics under a magnetic field. Additionally, b-PQDs can be electrically driven to emit single photons with 1 meV linewidth and photon-antibunching (g^2(0)=0.4). These results pave the way for on-chip, low-cost single-photon sources for next generation quantum optical communication and sensing.</description>
