      <title>Arbitrary state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing quantum states is a fundamental task in various quantum algorithms. In particular, state preparation in quantum harmonic oscillators (HOs) is crucial for the creation of qudits and the implementation of high-dimensional algorithms. In this work, we develop a methodology for preparing quantum states in HOs. The HO is coupled to an auxiliary qubit to ensure that any state can be prepared in the oscillator [J. Math. Phys. 59, 072101]. By applying a sequence of square pulses to both the qubit and the HO, we drive the system from an initial state to a target state. To determine the required pulses, we use a neural network that predicts the pulse parameters needed for state preparation. Specifically, we present results for preparing qubit and qutrit states in the HO, achieving average fidelities of 99.9% and 97.0%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Blinking optical tweezers for atom rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an energy-efficient approach for holding and rearranging an N x M atom array using only N optical tweezers. This is achieved through the sequential release and recapture of M single atoms by a single optical tweezer. By employing a stroboscopic harmonic potential, the phase-space quadrature of the atom's probability distribution can be maintained under this "blinking" potential, provided the trap frequency meets the appropriate conditions. Proof-of-principle experiments confirm that a blinking tweezer can trap M atoms while requiring only 1 / M of the power per atom, and it can even facilitate rearrangement, demonstrated with arrays of up to M = 9 atoms. This method offers a scalable and reconfigurable platform for optical tweezer arrays, crucial for the preparation and manipulation of large-scale qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-Point-Induced Nonequilibrium Entanglement Dynamics in Bosonic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), arising in non-Hermitian systems, have garnered significant attention in recent years, enabling advancements in sensing, wave manipulation, and mode selectivity. However, their role in quantum systems, particularly in influencing quantum correlations, remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate how EPs control multimode entanglement in bosonic chains. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework to describe the Heisenberg equations, we identify EPs of varying orders and uncover spectral transitions between purely real, purely imaginary, and mixed eigenvalue spectra. These spectral regions, divided by EPs, correspond to three distinct entanglement dynamics: oscillatory, exponential, and hybrid. Remarkably, we demonstrate that higher-order EPs, realized by non-integer-pi hopping phases or nonuniform interaction strengths, significantly enhance the degree of multimode entanglement compared to second-order EPs. Our findings provide a pathway to leveraging EPs for entanglement control and exhibit the potential of non-Hermitian physics in advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Geometric origin of self-intersection points in non-Hermitian energy spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian energy spectra under periodic boundary conditions can form closed loops in the complex energy plane, a phenomenon known as point gap topology. In this paper, we investigate the self-intersection points of such non-Hermitian energy spectra and reveal their geometric origins. We rigorously demonstrate that these self-intersection points result from the intersection of the auxiliary generalized Brillouin zone and the Brillouin zone in one-band systems, as confirmed by an extended Hatano-Nelson model. This finding is further generalized to multi-band systems, illustrated through a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Moreover, we address multiple self-intersection points and derive the geometric conditions for general n-fold self-intersection points. Our results enhance the fundamental understanding of generic non-Hermitian quantum systems and provide theoretical support for further experimental investigations of energy self-intersection points.</description>

      <title>Real-Field Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference of Indistinguishable Coherent Photons via Long Optical Injection-Locking over 50 km Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) has garnered significant attention for its potential to enable security-loophole-free quantum communication. Successful MDI-QKD protocols rely on performing a two-photon Bell-state measurement at an intermediate node, with a high-visibility Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference pattern between two independent coherent photons being crucial. In this study, we present a novel approach for developing indistinguishable coherent photon sources over 50 km of optical fiber in a real-world setting. We introduce the long optical injection-locking (long-OIL) technique, which enables frequency locking between two long-distance coherent photons beyond the coherence length of the master laser. Using the long-OIL technique, we achieved time-resolved HOM interference with a visibility of 48(2)%, approaching the theoretical 50% limit for two independent continuous-wave coherent photons. Our results demonstrate that the long-OIL platform is a promising solution for MDI-QKD with repeaterless secret key capacity.</description>

      <title>Population fluctuations increase the output of superradiant LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum nonlinear Maxwell-Bloch equations for the two-level active medium single-mode laser are solved without adiabatic elimination of the medium polarization in the LED regime, when the population fluctuation spectrum is much narrower than the radiation field and polarization spectra. It is shown that population fluctuations can significantly increase the output power and the collective Rabi splitting of a superradiant LED.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of boson sampling using detector binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a testing strategy for boson samplers that is based on efficiently computable expressions for the output photon counting distributions binned over multiple optical modes. We apply this method to validate boson sampling experiments with three photons on a reconfigurable photonic chip, which implements a four-mode interferometer, analyzing 50 Haar-random unitary transformations while tuning photon distinguishability via controlled delays. We show that for high values of indistinguishability, the experiment accurately reproduces the ideal boson sampling binned-mode distributions, which exhibit variations that depend both on the specific interferometer implemented as well as the choice of bin, confirming the usefulness of the method to diagnose imperfections such as partial distinguishability or imperfect chip control. Finally, we analyze the behavior of Haar-averaged binned-mode distributions with partial distinguishability and demonstrate analytically that its variance is proportional to the average of the square of the photons' indistinguishability parameter. These findings highlight the central role of binning in boson sampling validation, offering a scalable and efficient framework for assessing multiphoton interference and experimental performance.</description>
