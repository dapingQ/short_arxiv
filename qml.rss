      <title>Quantum Computing from Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stabilizer tableaus have proven exceptionally useful as a descriptive tool for additive quantum codes, they offer little guidance for concrete constructions or coding algorithm analysis. We introduce a representation of stabilizer codes as graphs with certain structures. Specifically, the graphs take a semi-bipartite form where input nodes map to output nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. Intuitively, the graph's input-output edges represent information propagation of the encoder, while output-output edges represent the code's entanglement. We prove that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a universal recipe for code construction by finding graphs with nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes. We construct several constant-size codes and several infinite code families. We also use graphs to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound to a three-way distance-rate-weight trade-off. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms, distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding, are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. We give efficient algorithms for producing encoding circuits whose depths scale with the degree and for implementing certain logical diagonal and Clifford gates with reduced depth. Finally, we find an efficient decoding algorithm for certain classes of graphs. These results give evidence that graphs are useful for the study of quantum computing and its implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a squeeze operator transformation approach to solve the anisotropic quantum Rabi model that includes a diamagnetic term. By carefully adjusting the amplitude of the diamagnetic term, we demonstrate that the anisotropic Rabi model with the $A^2$ term can be exactly reduced to either a Jaynes-Cummings or an anti-Jaynes-Cummings model without requiring any approximations.</description>

      <title>Realization of Two-dimensional Discrete Time Crystals with Anisotropic Heisenberg Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete time crystal (DTC) is the paradigmatic example of a phase of matter that occurs exclusively in systems out of equilibrium. This phenomenon is characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of discrete time-translation and provides a rich playground to study a fundamental question in statistical physics: what mechanism allows for driven quantum systems to exhibit emergent behavior that deviates from their counterparts with time-independent evolution? Unlike equilibrium phases, DTCs exhibit macroscopic manifestations of coherent quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional narrative that thermodynamic behavior universally erases quantum signatures. However, due to the difficulty of simulating these systems with either classical or quantum computers, previous studies have been limited to a set of models with Ising-like couplings -- and mostly only in one dimension -- thus precluding our understanding of the existence (or not) of DTCs in models with interactions that closely align with what occurs in nature. In this work, by combining the latest generation of IBM quantum processors with state-of-the-art tensor network methods, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a DTC in a two-dimensional system governed by anisotropic Heisenberg interactions. Our comprehensive analysis reveals a rich phase diagram encompassing spin-glass, ergodic, and time-crystalline phases, highlighting the tunability of these phases through multiple control parameters. Crucially, our results emphasize the interplay of initialization, interaction anisotropy, and driving protocols in stabilizing the DTC phase. By extending the study of Floquet matter beyond simplified models, we lay the groundwork for exploring how driven systems bridge the gap between quantum coherence and emergent non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental relativistic zero-knowledge proofs with unconditional security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are widely applied in digital economies, such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, for establishing trust and ensuring privacy between untrusted parties. However, almost all ZKPs rely on unproven computational assumptions or are vulnerable to quantum adversaries. We propose and experimentally implement an unconditionally secure ZKP for the graph three-coloring problem by combining subset relativistic bit commitments with quantum nonlocality game. Our protocol achieves a linear relationship between interactive rounds and the number of edges, reducing round complexity and storage requirements by thirteen orders of magnitude, thereby significantly enhancing practical feasibility. Our work illustrates the powerful potential of integrating special relativity with quantum theory in trustless cryptography, paving the way for robust applications against quantum attacks in distrustful internet environments.</description>

      <title>QNN-QRL: Quantum Neural Network Integrated with Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a critical component of secure communication in the quantum era, ensuring information-theoretic security. Despite its potential, there are issues in optimizing key generation rates, enhancing security, and incorporating QKD into practical implementations. This research introduces a unique framework for incorporating quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms, notably quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) and quantum neural networks (QNN), into QKD protocols to improve key generation performance. Here, we present two novel QRL-based algorithms, QRL-V.1 and QRL-V.2, and propose the standard BB84 and B92 protocols by integrating QNN algorithms to form QNN-BB84 and QNN-B92. Furthermore, we combine QNN with the above QRL-based algorithms to produce QNN-QRL-V.1 and QNN-QRL-V.2. These unique algorithms and established protocols are compared using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. The results from the QNN-based proposed algorithms show considerable improvements in key generation quality. The existing and proposed models are investigated in the presence of different noisy channels to check their robustness. The proposed integration of QML algorithms into QKD protocols and their noisy analysis create a new paradigm for efficient key generation, which advances the practical implementation of QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-controlled robust tripartite quantum entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of highly entangled states involving multiparticle systems is of crucial importance in quantum physics, playing a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics and offering essential quantum resources for nascent quantum technologies that surpass classical limits. Here we present how to generate and manipulate tripartite entangled state of photons, phonons, and magnons within a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system. It is shown that by simultaneously applying two coherent driving fields to this system in opposite input directions, it enables a coherent and effective way to regulate the magnomechanical interaction by tuning the phase difference of the driving fields. Based on this feature, it is found that the tripartite entanglement also becomes phase-dependent and can be enhanced for certain phase difference. More interestingly, it is shown that the robustness of tripartite entanglement against environmental thermal noises can also be improved by choosing proper phase difference of the driving fields. Our findings open up a promising way to manipulate and protect fragile tripartite entanglement, which is applicable to a wide range of quantum protocols that require multipartite entangled resources such as quantum communication and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Generation on the Double Quantum Transition of NV Ground State Via Globally Addressing Microwave Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key quantum feature that enables quantum sensors to improve their sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. In the NV-center platform, the Heisenberg limit can only be achieved when the axes of the NV centers are parallel. Nevertheless, parallel NV centers are spectrally indistinguishable and no mechanisms to prepare entanglement in such configurations are known to date. In this work we propose for the first time a mechanism to prepare entangled states in the double quantum transition of two dipolarly coupled NV centers whose axes are parallel. Our approach is based on the NV effective Raman coupling (NV-ERC) protocol and makes use of global addressing of both NV centers with a single monochromatic microwave pulse. Supported by an adiabatic elimination analysis, several mechanisms for the preparation of different entangled states are identified which avoid participation of intermediate states in all cases, thus limiting the impact of additional unwanted noise sources. We consider the generation of different entangled states belonging to the double quantum transition, sensitive to either transverse electric fields or longitudinal magnetic fields, all with a fourfold improved sensitivity compared to conventional single NV settings.</description>

      <title>Squeezing-enhanced accurate differential sensing under large phase noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are reaching sensitivities fundamentally constrained by quantum fluctuations. A main challenge is to integrate entanglement into quantum sensing protocols to enhance precision while ensuring robustness against noise and systematics. Here, we theoretically investigate differential phase measurements with two atom interferometers using spin-squeezed states, accounting for common-mode phase noise spanning the full $2\pi$ range. We estimate the differential signal using model-free ellipse fitting, a robust method requiring no device calibration and resilient to additional noise sources. Our results show that spin-squeezing enables sensitivities below the standard quantum limit. Specifically, we identify optimal squeezed states that minimize the differential phase variance, scaling as $N^{-2/3}$, while eliminating bias inherent in ellipse fitting methods. We benchmark our protocol against the Cram\'er-Rao bound and compare it with hybrid methods that incorporate auxiliary classical sensors. Our findings provide a pathway to robust and high-precision atom interferometry, in realistic noisy environments and using readily available states and estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Direct Implementation of High-Fidelity Three-Qubit Gates for Superconducting Processor with Tunable Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-qubit gates can be constructed using combinations of single-qubit and two-qubit gates, making their independent realization unnecessary. However, direct implementation of three-qubit gates reduces the depth of quantum circuits, streamlines quantum programming, and facilitates efficient circuit optimization, thereby enhancing overall performance in quantum computation. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity scheme for implementing a three-qubit controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gate in a flip-chip superconducting quantum processor with tunable couplers. This direct CCZ gate is implemented by simultaneously leveraging two tunable couplers interspersed between three qubits to enable three-qubit interactions, achieving an average final state fidelity of $97.94\%$ and a process fidelity of $93.54\%$. This high fidelity cannot be achieved through a simple combination of single- and two-qubit gate sequences from processors with similar performance levels. Our experiments also verify that multi-layer direct implementation of the CCZ gate exhibits lower leakage compared to decomposed gate approaches. To further showcase the versatility of our approach, we construct a Toffoli gate by combining the CCZ gate with Hadamard gates. As a showcase, we utilize the CCZ gate as an oracle to implement the Grover search algorithm on three qubits, demonstrating high performance with the target probability amplitude significantly enhanced after two iterations. These results highlight the advantage of our approach, and facilitate the implementation of complex quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Key Distribution using Decoy Pulses to Combat Photon-Number Splitting by Eavesdropper: An Event-by-Event Impairment Enumeration Approach for Performance Evaluation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-key distribution (QKD) schemes employing quantum communication links are typically based on the transmission of weak optical pulses over optical fibers to setup a secret key between the transmitting and receiving nodes. Alice transmits optically a random bit stream to the receiver (Bob) through the photon polarizations or the quadrature components of the lightwaves associated with the photons, with a secret key remaining implicitly embedded therein. However, during the above transmission, some eavesdropper (Eve) might attempt to tap the passing-by photons from the optical fiber links to extract the key. In one of the popular QKD schemes, along with signal pulses, some additional decoy pulses are transmitted by Alice, while Eve might use photon-number splitting (PNS) for eavesdropping. In a typical PNS scheme, (i) the optical pulses with single photon are blocked by Eve, (ii) from the optical pulses with two photons, one photon is retained by Eve to carry out eavesdropping operation and the other is retransmitted to Bob, and (iii) all other pulses with more than two photons are retransmitted by Eve to Bob without retaining any photon from them. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out on such QKD schemes, by employing information-theoretic approach along with computer simulations and experimental studies. We present a novel event-by-event impairment enumeration approach to evaluate the overall performance of one such QKD scheme analytically with due consideration to the physical layer of the quantum communication links. The proposed approach monitors the impairments of the propagating optical pulses event-by-event at all possible locations along the optical fiber link using statistical approach, and provides estimates of the realizable key generation rate, while assuring an adequate yield ratio between signal and decoy pulses for the detection of possible eavesdropping.</description>

      <title>Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate is a two-qubit controlled-phase gate in ion traps that is highly valued due to its ability to preserve the motional state of the ions. However, its fidelity is obstructed by errors affecting the motion of the ions as well as the rotation of the qubits. In this work, we propose an amplitude-modulated composite MS gate which features high fidelity robust to gate timing, detuning and coupling errors.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in fermionic two-body continuous-time quantum walk under the steepest entropy ascent formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks play a crucial role in quantum algorithms and computational problems. Many-body quantum walks can reveal and exploit quantum correlations that are unavailable for single-walker cases. Studying quantum walks under noise and dissipation, particularly in multi-walker systems, has significant implications. In this context, we use a thermodynamically consistent formalism of dissipation modeling, namely the steepest entropy ascent (SEA) formalism. We analyze two spinless fermionic continuous-time walkers on a 1D graph with tunable Hubbard and extended Hubbard-like interactions. By contrasting SEA-driven dynamics with unitary evolution, we systematically investigate how interaction strengths modulate thermalization and entropy production. Our findings highlight the relevance of SEA formalism in modeling nonlinear dissipation in many-body quantum systems and its implications for quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Expectation Values via Exponential Error Suppression and CVaR Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise quantum expectation values are crucial for quantum algorithm development, but noise in real-world systems can degrade these estimations. While quantum error correction is resource-intensive, error mitigation strategies offer a practical alternative. This paper presents a framework that combines Virtual Channel Purification (VCP) technique with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization to improve expectation value estimations in noisy quantum circuits. Our contributions are twofold: first, we derive conditions to compare CVaR values from different probability distributions, offering insights into the reliability of quantum estimations under noise. Second, we apply this framework to VCP, providing analytical bounds that establish its effectiveness in improving expectation values, both when the overhead VCP circuit is ideal (error-free) and when it adds additional noise. By introducing CVaR into the analysis of VCP, we offer a general noise-characterization method that guarantees improved expectation values for any quantum observable. We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach with numerical examples, highlighting how our bounds guide VCP implementation in noisy quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian dynamics simulation using linear combination of unitaries on an ion trap quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear combination of unitaries (LCU) method has proven to scale better than existing product formulas in simulating long time Hamiltonian dynamics. However, given the number of multi-control gate operations in the standard prepare-select-unprepare architecture of LCU, it is still resource-intensive to implement on the current quantum computers. In this work, we demonstrate LCU implementations on an ion trap quantum computer for calculating squared overlaps $|\langle \psi(t=0)|\psi(t&gt;0)\rangle|^2$ of time-evolved states. This is achieved by an optimized LCU method, based on pre-selecting relevant unitaries, coupled with a compilation strategy which makes use of quantum multiplexor gates, leading to a significant reduction in the depth and number of two-qubit gates in circuits. For $L$ Pauli strings in a $n$-qubit-mapped Hamiltonian, we find a two-qubit gate count of $2^{\lceil log_2(L)\rceil}(2n+1)-n-2$. We test this approach by simulating a Rabi-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Impact of qubit anharmonicity on near-resonant Rabi oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise quantum control relies on a deep understanding of the dynamics of quantum systems under external drives. This study investigates the impact of anharmonicity on qubit dynamics under conditions typical for two-qubit entangling gates activated by weak near-resonant microwave drives. We measure the Rabi oscillation frequency as a function of drive amplitude and detuning. Our results reveal a linear dependence of the squared Rabi frequency on the squared drive amplitude, which relates to the ratio of detuning to anharmonicity, demonstrating strong agreement between experimental data and analytical predictions. Additionally, we analyze the leakage and phase errors arising from inaccurate Rabi frequency adjustments in the CZ gate implementation on fluxonium qubits driven by a microwave signal applied to the coupler.</description>

      <title>Mitigating shot noise in local overlapping quantum tomography with semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced density matrices (RDMs) are fundamental in quantum information processing, allowing the computation of local observables, such as energy and correlation functions, without the exponential complexity of fully characterizing quantum states. In the context of near-term quantum computing, RDMs provide sufficient information to effectively design variational quantum algorithms. However, their experimental estimation is challenging, as it involves preparing and measuring quantum states in multiple bases - a resource-intensive process susceptible to producing non-physical RDMs due to shot noise from limited measurements. To address this, we propose a method to mitigate shot noise by re-enforcing certain physicality constraints on RDMs. While verifying RDM compatibility with a global state is QMA-complete, we relax this condition by enforcing compatibility constraints up to a certain level using a polynomial-size semidefinite program to reconstruct overlapping RDMs from simulated experimental data. Our approach yields, on average, tighter bounds for the same number of measurements compared to tomography without compatibility constraints. We demonstrate the versatility and efficacy of our method by integrating it into an algorithmic cooling procedure to prepare low-energy states of local Hamiltonians. Simulations on frustrated Hamiltonians reveal notable improvements in accuracy and resource efficiency, highlighting the potential of our approach for practical applications in near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>
