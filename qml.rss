      <title>Deterministic Fault-Tolerant State Preparation for Near-Term Quantum Error Correction: Automatic Synthesis Using Boolean Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure resilience against the unavoidable noise in quantum computers, quantum information needs to be encoded using an error-correcting code, and circuits must have a particular structure to be fault-tolerant. Compilation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits is thus inherently different from the non-fault-tolerant case. However, automated fault-tolerant compilation methods are widely underexplored, and most known constructions are obtained manually for specific codes only. In this work, we focus on the problem of automatically synthesizing fault-tolerant circuits for the deterministic initialization of an encoded state for a broad class of quantum codes that are realizable on current and near-term hardware.
  To this end, we utilize methods based on techniques from classical circuit design, such as satisfiability solving, resulting in tools for the synthesis of (optimal) fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for near-term quantum codes. We demonstrate the correct fault-tolerant behavior of the synthesized circuits using circuit-level noise simulations. We provide all routines as open-source software as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc.</description>

      <title>Teleportation and Entanglement Swapping of Continuous Quantum Variables of Microwave Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication is needed to build powerful quantum computers and establish reliable quantum networks. At its basis lies the ability to generate and distribute entanglement to separate quantum systems, which can be used to run remote quantum operations on them or teleport quantum states from one system to another with the help of classical channels. To this end, it is useful to harness the resource of continuous-variable (CV) entanglement since it can be efficiently and unconditionally produced by squeezing light in a nonlinear medium and can be easily manipulated, distributed, and measured using standard components. While various aspects of CV-based quantum communication have been successfully demonstrated in the optical domain, some key capabilities, such as entanglement swapping, have been lacking in the microwave domain. Here, we demonstrate three key elements of CV-based microwave quantum communication, (1) a Josephson mixer operating as nondegenerate two-mode entangler with maximum measured logarithmic negativity E_N=1.5, (2) a quantum teleportation apparatus, capable of teleporting vacuum and coherent states with a maximum fidelity of 73%, which exceeds the 50% classical limit and is mainly limited by intermediate losses in the setup, and (3) an entanglement swapping system which generates entanglement between two remote noninteracting modes via entanglement swapping operations applied to input vacuum and coherent states with maximum measured logarithmic negativity E_N=0.53. Such hardware-efficient CV entanglement building blocks that are based on nondegenerate Josephson mixers could enable wide-ranging applications in modular quantum computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Approaches to Solving the Shipment Rerouting Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a shipment rerouting problem (SRP) which generalizes many NP-hard sequencing and packing problems. A SRP's solution has ample practical applications in vehicle scheduling and transportation logistics. Given a network of hubs, a set of goods must be delivered by trucks from their source-hubs to their respective destination-hubs. The objective is to select a set of trucks and to schedule these trucks' routes so that the total cost is minimized. The problem SRP is NP-hard; only classical approximation algorithms have been known for some of its NP-hard variants. In this work, we design classical algorithms and quantum annealing algorithms for this problem with various capacitated trucks. The algorithms that we design use novel mathematical programming formulations and new insights into solving sequencing and packing problems simultaneously. Such formulations take advantage of network infrastructure, shipments, and truck capacities. We conduct extensive experiments showing that in various scenarios, the quantum annealing solver generates near-optimal or optimal solutions much faster than the classical algorithm solver.</description>

      <title>Learning to Measure Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has attracted growing attention, prompting extensive research into quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to solve diverse and complex problems. Designing high-performance QML models demands expert-level proficiency, which remains a significant obstacle to the broader adoption of QML. A few major hurdles include crafting effective data encoding techniques and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are crucial to the performance of QML models. Additionally, the measurement phase is frequently overlooked-most current QML models rely on pre-defined measurement protocols that often fail to account for the specific problem being addressed. We introduce a novel approach that makes the observable of the quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-learnable. Our method features an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, where the parameterized observable is trained alongside the ordinary quantum circuit parameters simultaneously. Using numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method can identify observables for variational quantum circuits that lead to improved outcomes, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby boosting the overall performance of QML models.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Enhanced Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolver for General Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a promising approach for achieving quantum advantage on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, their large-scale applications are significantly hindered by optimization challenges, such as the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon, local minima, and numerous iteration demands. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion models (DMs) to address these difficulties. The DM is trained on a few data points in the Heisenberg model parameter space and then can be guided to generate high-performance parameters for parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) tasks for general Hamiltonians. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DM-parameterized VQE can explore the ground-state energies of Heisenberg models with parameters not included in the training dataset. Even when applied to previously unseen Hamiltonians, such as the Ising and Hubbard models, it can generate the appropriate initial state to achieve rapid convergence and mitigate the BP and local minima problems. These results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method in improving optimization efficiency for general Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Parameter Estimation via Dynamical Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum theory, the inescapable interaction between a system and its surroundings would lead to a loss of coherence and leakage of information into the environment. An effective approach to retain the quantum characteristics of the system is to decouple it from the environment. However, things get complicated in quantum parameter estimation tasks, especially when the unknown parameter originates from the environment. Here, we propose a general dynamical modulation scheme that enables the enhancement of estimation precision irrespective of the origin of the parameters to be estimated. Notably, beyond the capability of dynamically decoupling the system from the environment, our proposal can select the effective frequency of the system and in turn manipulate the dynamics of the system, such as the steady-state probability and the decay rate, which are sensitive to the bath parameter. Therefore, the quantum Fisher information is dramatically increased, leading to superior estimation precision. Specifically, we elucidate the effectiveness of our proposal with prototypical examples of the Ramsey spectroscopy and quantum thermometer. Our findings offer an alternative route to enhance the precision of quantum estimation processes and may have potential applications in diverse branches of quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Myths around quantum computation before full fault tolerance: What no-go theorems rule out and what they don't</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this perspective article, we revisit and critically evaluate prevailing viewpoints on the capabilities and limitations of near-term quantum computing and its potential transition toward fully fault-tolerant quantum computing. We examine theoretical no-go results and their implications, addressing misconceptions about the practicality of quantum error mitigation techniques and variational quantum algorithms. By emphasizing the nuances of error scaling, circuit depth, and algorithmic feasibility, we highlight viable near-term applications and synergies between error mitigation and early fault-tolerant architectures. Our discussion explores strategies for addressing current challenges, such as barren plateaus in variational circuits and the integration of quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction techniques. We aim to underscore the importance of continued innovation in hardware and algorithmic design to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical utility, paving the way for meaningful quantum advantage in the era of late noisy intermediate scale and early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Satellite-based communication for phase-matching measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility of the phase-matching measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (PM-MDI QKD) protocol proposed by Lin and L\"utkenhaus for satellite-based quantum communication. The protocol's key rate, known to exceed the repeaterless bound, is evaluated in the asymptotic limit under noisy conditions typical of satellite communications, including loss-only scenarios. The setup involves two ground-based parties connected via fiber (lossonly or noisy) and a space-based third party linked to one of these two ground-based parties through free-space communication. Simulations using the elliptic-beam approximation model the average key rate (AKR) and its probability distribution (PDR) across varying zenith angles and fiber distances. Down-link free-space communication is assessed under day and night conditions, with intensity optimization for each graphical point. Dynamic configurations of satellite and ground stations are also considered. Results indicate that AKR decays more slowly under loss-only conditions, while PDR analysis shows higher key rates produce more concentrated distributions. These findings demonstrate the potential of PM-MDI QKD protocols for achieving reliable key rates in satellitebased quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient optimization of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) is critical for their successful application in quantum computing. The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method, which leverages the geometry of quantum state space, has demonstrated improved convergence compared to standard gradient descent [Quantum 4, 269 (2020)]. In this work, we introduce the Modified Conjugate Quantum Natural Gradient (CQNG), an optimization algorithm that integrates QNG with principles from the nonlinear conjugate gradient method. Unlike QNG, which employs a fixed learning rate, CQNG dynamically adjusts hyperparameters at each step, enhancing both efficiency and flexibility. Numerical simulations show that CQNG achieves faster convergence than QNG across various optimization scenarios, even when strict conjugacy conditions are not always satisfied -- hence the term ``Modified Conjugate.'' These results highlight CQNG as a promising optimization technique for improving the performance of VQAs.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional quantum key distribution rates for multiple measurement bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the advantages of high-dimensional encoding for a quantum key distribution protocol. In particular, we address a BBM92-like protocol where the dimension of the systems can be larger than two and more than two mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) can be employed. Indeed, it is known that, for a system whose dimension $d$ is a prime or the power of a prime, up to $d+1$ MUBs can be found. We derive an analytic expression for the asymptotic key rate when $d+1$ MUBs are exploited and show the effects of using different numbers of MUBs on the performance of the protocol. Then, we move to the non-asymptotic case and optimize the finite key rate against collective and coherent attacks for generic dimension of the systems and all possible numbers of MUBs. In the finite-key scenario, we find that, if the number of rounds is small enough, the highest key rate is obtained by exploiting three MUBs, instead of $d+1$ as one may expect.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium in silicon carbide is a promising spin photon interface candidate with optical transitions in the telecom range and a long lived electron spin, hosted in an advanced semiconductor platform. In this detailed investigation of the defect's 16-dimensional ground state spin manifold at millikelvin temperatures, a wide range of previously unreported transitions are observed which are accurately described using a theoretical model that includes strain. Using a superconducting microcoil we achieve Rabi frequencies exceeding 20 MHz and perform the first coherent manipulation of a direct hyperfine transition. These insights further underscore the defect's potential for strain engineering and sensing, as well as for fault-tolerant qudit encoding.</description>

      <title>Q-MAML: Quantum Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to solve optimization problems has become a key application. However, these algorithms face significant challenges, such as choosing an effective initial set of parameters and the limited quantum processing time that restricts the number of optimization iterations. In this study, we introduce a new framework for optimizing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that employs a classical optimizer, inspired by Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) technique. This approach aim to achieve better parameter initialization that ensures fast convergence. Our framework features a classical neural network, called Learner}, which interacts with a PQC using the output of Learner as an initial parameter. During the pre-training phase, Learner is trained with a meta-objective based on the quantum circuit cost function. In the adaptation phase, the framework requires only a few PQC updates to converge to a more accurate value, while the learner remains unchanged. This method is highly adaptable and is effectively extended to various Hamiltonian optimization problems. We validate our approach through experiments, including distribution function mapping and optimization of the Heisenberg XYZ Hamiltonian. The result implies that the Learner successfully estimates initial parameters that generalize across the problem space, enabling fast adaptation.</description>

      <title>Witnessing global memory effects of multiqubit correlated noisy channels by Hilbert-Schmidt speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In correlated noisy channels, the global memory effects on the dynamics of a quantum system depend on both non-Markovianity of the single noisy channel (intrinsic memory) and classical correlations between multiple uses of the channel itself (correlation-based memory). We show that the Hilbert-Schmidt speed (HSS), a measure of non-Markovianity, serves as a reliable figure of merit for evaluating the role of this correlation-based memory on the global memory effects, for both unital and non-unital channels. The intensity of the correlation-based memory is ruled by a classical correlation strength between consecutive applications of the channel. We demonstrate that, for unital noisy channels, increasing the number of qubits of the system significantly weakens the sensitivity of the HSS to this classical correlation strength. Such a pattern indicates that the state evolution of large quantum systems may be less prone to be affected by classical correlations between noisy channels. Moreover, assuming the qubits are affected by independent or classically correlated local non-Markovian unital channels, we observe that, as the number of qubits increases, the collective behavior of the multiqubit system inhibits the non-Markovian features of the overall system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of parity-symmetry-protected phenomena in the quantum Rabi model with a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is crucial for gaining insights into the fundamental properties of physical systems, bringing possibilities in studying exotic phenomena such as quantum phase transitions and ground state entanglement. Here, we experimentally simulate a highly controllable extended quantum Rabi model, capable of tuning into the ultra-strong or deep coupling regime, in a spin-motion-coupled trapped ion. We observe that the phonon driven by such a model with parity symmetry preserved (broken) would experience double (single) excitation in the ultra-strong coupling regime. Quantum phenomena such as strong ground state entanglement and quantum superposition in systems occur with parity symmetry, and these phenomena disappear following the symmetry breaking. We also find sensitive responses for the two-level system entropy and phonon Wigner function in the deep coupling regime, depending on the parameter across the symmetry transition point. This work offers the prospect of exploring symmetry-controlled quantum phenomena and their applications in high-precision quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dissipating quartets of excitations in a superconducting circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, autonomous stabilization of bosonic qubits has emerged as a promising approach for hardware-efficient protection of quantum information. However, applying these techniques to more complex encodings than the Schr\"odinger cat code requires exquisite control of high-order wave mixing processes. The challenge is to enable specific multiphotonic dissipation channels while avoiding unintended non-linear interactions. In this work, we leverage a genuine six-wave mixing process enabled by a near Kerr-free Josephson element to enforce dissipation of quartets of excitations in a high-impedance superconducting resonator. Owing to residual non-linearities stemming from stray inductances in our circuit, this dissipation channel is only effective when the resonator holds a specific number of photons. Applying it to the fourth excited state of the resonator, we show an order of magnitude enhancement of the state decay rate while only marginally impacting the relaxation and coherence of lower energy states. Given that stray inductances could be strongly reduced through simple modifications in circuit design and that our methods can be adapted to activate even higher-order dissipation channels, these results pave the way toward the dynamical stabilization of four-component Schr\"odinger cat qubits and even more complex bosonic qubits.</description>

      <title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to QSP pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) relies on a historically costly pre-processing step, "QSP-processing/phase-factor finding." QSP-processing is now a developed topic within quantum algorithms literature, and a beginner accessible review of QSP-processing is overdue. This work provides a whirlwind tour through QSP conventions and pre-processing methods, beginning from a pedagogically accessible QSP convention. We then review QSP conventions associated with three common polynomial types: real polynomials with definite parity, sums of reciprocal/anti-reciprocal Chebyshev polynomials, and complex polynomials. We demonstrate how the conventions perform with respect to three criteria: circuit length, polynomial conditions, and pre-processing methods.
  We then review the recently introduced Wilson method for QSP-processing and give conditions where it can succeed with bound error. Although the resulting bound is not computationally efficient, we demonstrate that the method succeeds with linear error propagation for relevant target polynomials and precision regimes, including the Jacobi-Anger expansion used in Hamiltonian simulation algorithms. We then apply our benchmarks to three QSP-processing methods for QSP circuits and show that a method introduced by Berntson and S\"underhauf outperforms both the Wilson method and the standard optimization strategy for complex polynomials.</description>

      <title>Free temporal evolution of a superbandwidth wave packet: The quantum tale of the hare and the tortoise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can the interplay between quantum mechanics and classical optics offer new perspectives on wavepacket dynamics? Building on this connection, we show that local momenta with both super-oscillatory and suboscillatory characteristics can arise during the free propagation of a quantum particle. This behavior is mathematically analogous to the propagation of a superbandwidth laser pulse in a dispersive medium, where the instantaneous frequencies of the electric field exhibit similar sub- and super-oscillatory features. This analogy is rooted in the equivalence between the wave description of light in classical optics and the formalism of quantum mechanics. In addition, we explore the phenomenon of wavepacket localization during free propagation within a bounded region. This localization is directly linked to the distribution of local momenta within the confined wavepacket region. To complement our quantum mechanical analysis, we also perform a classical analysis to provide further insights into this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that both the emergence of local momenta with sub- and super-oscillatory features and the wavepacket localization occur within a distinct timescale, which we define as the interference time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review concepts and recent work related to creating light-matter interfaces for future quantum networks based on rare-earth ion-doped crystals. More precisely, we explore their unique suitability for creating photon sources, optical quantum memories for light, and qubits that allow quantum information processing. In addition, we review the state-of-the-art of elementary quantum repeater links, and provide suggestions for future research.</description>

      <title>Exact steady state of perturbed open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general non-perturbative method to determine the exact perturbed steady state of open quantum systems, in terms of the eigenmodes of the unperturbed system. The perturbation may be time-independent or periodic, and of arbitrarily large amplitude. Using a generalized inverse and two diagonalizations, we construct an operator that generates the entire dependence of the steady state on the perturbation parameter. The approach also enables exact analytic operations-such as differentiation, integration, and ensemble averaging-with respect to the parameter, even when the steady state is computed numerically. We apply the method to three non-trivial open quantum systems, showing that it achieves exact results, with a computational speedup for calculations requiring large sampling, such as ensemble averaging, compared to sampling-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Hidden entanglement in twin beams generated through optical parametric amplification in hot alkali atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper characterization of quantum correlations in a multimode optical state is critical for applications in quantum information science; however, the most common entanglement measurements can lead to an incomplete state reconstruction. This is the case for the ubiquitous spectral measurement of field quadratures for which a full characterization of the quantum correlations between optical beams is not possible. We demonstrate this effect in twin beams generated through parametric amplification by four-wave mixing in hot rubidium vapor, showing the role of a frequency dependent gain response. We implement a resonator-based measurement that reveals entanglement between beams that is otherwise hidden by usual spectral measurements. Additionally, this system shows how the phase shifts between the carrier and the sidebands on the involved fields affect the observation of entanglement for different entanglement witnesses, demonstrating the relevance of making a complete state tomography.</description>

      <title>Randomized benchmarking with non-Markovian noise and realistic finite-time gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of non-Markovian classical noise on single-qubit randomized benchmarking experiments, in a manner that explicitly models the realization of each gate via realistic finite-duration pulses. Our new framework exploits the random nature of each gate sequence to derive expressions for the full survival probability decay curve which are non-perturbative in the noise strength. In the presence of non-Markovian noise, our approach shows that the decay curve can exhibit a strong dependence on the implementation method, with regimes of both exponential and power law decays. We discuss how these effects can complicate the interpretation of a randomized-benchmarking experiment, but also how to leverage them to probe non-Markovianty.</description>

      <title>Measuring Non-Gaussian Magic in Fermions: Convolution, Entropy, and the Violation of Wick's Theorem and the Matchgate Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically hard to simulate quantum states, or "magic states", are prerequisites to quantum advantage, highlighting an apparent separation between classically and quantumly tractable problems. Classically simulable states such as Clifford circuits on stabilizer states, free bosonic states, free fermions, and matchgate circuits are all in some sense Gaussian. While free bosons and fermions arise from quadratic Hamiltonians, recent works have demonstrated that bosonic and qudit systems converge to Gaussians and stabilizers under convolution. In this work, we similarly identify convolution for fermions and find efficient measures of non-Gaussian magic in pure fermionic states. We demonstrate that three natural notions for the Gaussification of a state, (1) the Gaussian state with the same covariance matrix, (2) the fixed point of convolution, and (3) the closest Gaussian in relative entropy, coincide by proving a central limit theorem for fermionic systems. We then utilize the violation of Wick's theorem and the matchgate identity to quantify non-Gaussian magic in addition to a SWAP test.</description>
