      <title>A visual representation of the properties of pre- and post- selected entangled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a visual representation for generating entangled-based quantum effects under pre- and post- selected states that allows us to reveal equivalence between seemingly different quantum effects. We show how to realize entangled quantum systems of an arbitrary number of qubits from a single or pre-specified number of physical particles. We then show that a variation of the quantum Cheshire cat experiment and Hardy's paradox are equivalent and propose a class of experiments that generalizes both experiments. We show that the weak values of the products of projection operators allow us to get the weak value of each projection operator, implying that the weak value of the product of projection operators includes the entire information about the weak values in the system. In nature, interactions can only be acted between a pair of particles. We show how to realize quantum systems of multiwise interacted qubits, i.e., interactions that come in groups of n&gt;2 qubits. In this way, we are able to propose unique quantum systems that consist of interacted groups of entangled states. The proposed framework opens the door toward a new way to explore quantum systems of entangled particles and quantum phenomena that emerge from such a general setting.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Genetic Algorithms for Pulse-Level Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise remains a fundamental challenge in quantum computing, significantly affecting pulse fidelity and overall circuit performance. This paper introduces an adaptive algorithm for pulse-level quantum error mitigation, designed to enhance fidelity by dynamically responding to noise conditions without modifying circuit gates. By targeting pulse parameters directly, this method reduces the impact of various noise sources, improving algorithm resilience in quantum circuits. We show the latter by applying our protocol to Grover's and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms. Experimental results show that this pulse-level strategy provides a flexible and efficient solution for increasing fidelity during the noisy execution of quantum circuits. Our work contributes to advancements in error mitigation techniques, essential for robust quantum computing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method for the implementation of quantum algorithms that optimizes both gate count and circuit depth. Our approach introduces connectivity-adapted CNOT-based building blocks called Parity Twine chains. It outperforms all known state-of-the art methods for implementing prominent quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform or the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm across a wide range of quantum hardware, including linear, square-grid, hexagonal, ladder and all-to-all devices. For specific cases, we rigorously prove the optimality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Bell nonlocality in quantum networks with unreliable sources: Loophole-free postelection via self-testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Bell nonlocality in quantum networks with unreliable sources. Our main result is a condition on the observed data which ensures that inconclusive events can be safely discarded, without introducing any loophole. More formally, we characterize the fair-sampling property for measurements in a network. When all measurements are fair-sampling, we show that the post-selection of conclusive outcomes does not compromise the assumption of source independence, hence avoiding the detection loophole. Furthermore, we show that in some cases, the fair-sampling property can in fact be guaranteed based only on observed data. To show this, we prove that saturation of the Finner inequality provides a self-test of the underlying quantum model. We illustrate the relevance of our results by demonstrating an improvement in device-independent randomness generation for a photonic Bell test with a probabilistic source and for the triangle network.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum error correction based on hyperbolic Floquet codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers significant speedups, but the large number of physical qubits required for quantum error correction introduces engineering challenges for a monolithic architecture. One solution is to distribute the logical quantum computation across multiple small quantum computers, with non-local operations enabled via distributed Bell states. Previous investigations of distributed quantum error correction have largely focused on the surface code, which offers good error suppression but poor encoding rates, with each surface code instance only able to encode a single logical qubit. In this work, we argue that hyperbolic Floquet codes are particularly well-suited to distributed quantum error correction for two reasons. Firstly, their hyperbolic structure enables a high number of logical qubits to be stored efficiently. Secondly, the fact that all measurements are between pairs of qubits means that each measurement only requires a single Bell state. Through simulations, we show that distributed hyperbolic Floquet codes offer good performance under local and non-local phenomenological noise. This shows that distributed quantum error correction is not only possible but efficiently realisable.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Verification of Non-Gaussian Coherence in Bosonic Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity, a distinctive characteristic of bosonic quantum states, is pivotal in advancing quantum networks, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and high-precision metrology. Verifying the quantum nature of a state, particularly its non-Gaussian features, is essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of these technologies. However, the specific properties required for each application demand tailored validation thresholds. Here, we introduce a hierarchical framework comprising absolute, relative, and qubit-specific thresholds to assess the non-Gaussianity of local coherences. We illustrate this framework using heralded optical non-Gaussian states with the highest purities available in optical platforms. This comprehensive framework presents the first detailed evaluation of number state coherences and can be extended to a wide range of bosonic states.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies of quantum non-Gaussian coherences for bosonic systems: a theoretical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence in bosonic systems is a fundamental resource for quantum technology applications. In this work, we introduce a framework for analyzing coherence in the Fock-state basis, utilizing context-dependent certification to reveal the quantum non-Gaussian nature of the tested coherence. Rather than relying on global coherence measures, our approach targets specific aspects of coherence, enabling a tailored hierarchical classification. We derive and compare two distinct hierarchies, each representing a different context for coherence in bosonic systems. Motivated by current advancements in optical quantum state engineering, we assess the feasibility and depth of these hierarchies under conditions of loss and thermal noise. The methodology introduced here is versatile and can be extended to multi-state and multi-mode coherences, making it adaptable to a wide range of experimental scenarios and platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in molecular optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed a theoretical scheme to investigate how to generate the nonreciprocal bipartite entanglement between cavity mode and vibrational modes in a molecular cavity optomechanical system. Our system consists of $\mathcal{N}$ molecules within a spinning whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator whose vibrations can be strongly entangled with an auxiliary cavity and plasmonic cavity. We find that nonreciprocal photon-vibration entanglement and nonreciprocal vibration-vibration entanglement can exist in our system at high temperatures. These nonreciprocal entanglements are induced by the Sagnac-Fizeau effect. The two types of nonreciprocal entanglements can be enhanced by spinning the WGM resonator in the CCW direction. This ensures that the optical photon is driven by blue-detuned driving field. Moreover, we find that the vibration-vibration entanglement can be greatly enhanced as the number of the molecules increases. Our work finds applications in quantum information transmission</description>

      <title>A Unified Blockwise Measurement Design for Learning Quantum Channels and Lindbladians via Low-Rank Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum superoperator learning is a pivotal task in quantum information science, enabling accurate reconstruction of unknown quantum operations from measurement data. We propose a robust approach based on the matrix sensing techniques for quantum superoperator learning that extends beyond the positive semidefinite case, encompassing both quantum channels and Lindbladians. We first introduce a randomized measurement design using a near-optimal number of measurements. By leveraging the restricted isometry property (RIP), we provide theoretical guarantees for the identifiability and recovery of low-rank superoperators in the presence of noise. Additionally, we propose a blockwise measurement design that restricts the tomography to the sub-blocks, significantly enhancing performance while maintaining a comparable scale of measurements. We also provide a performance guarantee for this setup. Our approach employs alternating least squares (ALS) with acceleration for optimization in matrix sensing. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of quantum computing is generating significant anticipation within the scientific and industrial communities due to its potential to revolutionize computing paradigms. Recognizing this potential, this paper explores the integration of transfer of knowledge techniques, traditionally used in classical artificial intelligence, into quantum computing. We present a comprehensive classification of the transfer models, focusing on Transfer Learning and Transfer Optimization. Additionally, we analyze relevant schemes in quantum computing that can benefit from knowledge sharing, and we delve into the potential synergies, supported by theoretical insights and initial experimental results. Our findings suggest that leveraging the transfer of knowledge can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of quantum algorithms, particularly in the context of hybrid solvers. This approach not only accelerates the optimization process but also reduces the computational burden on quantum processors, making it a valuable tool for advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of classical realism under successive noncommuting measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics has been addressed over time through numerous frameworks, from Bohr's correspondence principle to quantum Darwinism. Traditional approaches associate the emergence of classicality with the decoherence process induced by large reservoirs on the system's state. In this work, we present an effective mechanism by which classicality emerges through the establishment of elements of reality. This involves the process of successive monitoring of noncommuting observables. To assess physical reality, we employ the realism criterion introduced by Bilobran and Angelo [EPL, 112 (2015) 40005], as well as their quantifier for the violations of this criterion. With these tools, we formally demonstrate, for generic systems, that a quasi-classical regime can always be reached with a sufficiently large number of incompatible measurements. Thus, instead of diagnosing the emergence of the classical regime in terms of the resulting algebraic characteristics for the density operator under the action of large reservoirs, our results reveal that classicality can emerge, at the level of physical elements of reality, from the coupling of the system with environments of a few degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Single-shot detection limits of quantum illumination with multipartite qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum illumination is a protocol for detecting a low-reflectivity target by using two-mode entangled states composed of signal and idler modes. In this study, we extend the two-mode qubit states to three-mode qubit states, exploring the following configurations: (i) three signals, (ii) two signals and one idler, and (iii) one signal and two idlers. Each configuration considers various three-qubit states, such as GHZ state, W state, bipartite entangled states, and product states. We derive single-shot detection limits of the three-qubit states under white noise environment, evaluating the detection error probabilities for each configuration. We obtain that the performance is enhanced by the entanglement between signal and idler qubits, whereas it is degraded by the entanglement between signal qubits. In particular, the optimal probe state is not a maximally entangled state but a bipartite entangled state. Moreover, we show that the order of detection error probabilities is consistently certified by the quantum mutual information for the three-qubit probe states. Furthermore, we devote attention to whether this tendency maintains even in multipartite qudit states.</description>

      <title>Tight Sample Complexity Bounds for Parameter Estimation Under Quantum Differential Privacy for Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note provides tight upper and lower bounds for minimal number of samples (copies of quantum states) required to attain a prescribed accuracy (measured by error variance) for scalar parameters using unbiased estimators under quantum local differential privacy for qubits. In the small privacy budget $\epsilon$ regime, i.e., $\epsilon\ll 1$, the sample complexity scales as $\Theta(\epsilon^{-2})$. This bound matches that of classical parameter estimation under differential privacy. The lower bound loosens (converges to zero) in the large privacy budget regime, i.e., $\epsilon\gg 1$, but that case is not particularly interesting as tight bounds for parameter estimation in the noiseless case are widely known. That being said, extensions to systems with higher dimensions and tightening the bounds for the large privacy budget regime are interesting avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Optimized Spectral Purity of Heralded Single Photons at the Telecom O-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on optimizing the spectral purity of heralded single photons in the telecom O-band, where single photons can be propagated with low loss and low dispersion in a standard telecom optical fiber. We numerically searched for various group-velocity-matching conditions and corresponding optimal poling structures of a potassium titanyl phosphate crystal for spontaneous parametric downconversion. Our poling optimization results using phase-matching coherence-length and sub-coherence-length modulation schemes show &gt; 99.4% spectral purity with pump wavelengths ranging from 603.8 nm to 887.3 nm. Some optimized configurations are feasible with off-the-shelf lasers and single-photon detectors. Moreover, by investigating noise photon spectra for different poling optimization methods, we show that, in practice, appropriate, gentle spectral filtering helps achieve high purity. This study will pave the way for developing practical quantum sources for quantum information applications at the telecom O-band.</description>

      <title>Cylindrically confined $H$ atom in magnetic field: variational cut-off factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider the hydrogen atom confined within an impenetrable infinite cylindrical cavity of radius $\rho_{0}$ in the presence of a constant magnetic field ${\bf B} = B\,{\hat{\bf z}}$ oriented along the main cylinder's axis. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, anchoring the nucleus to the geometric center of the cylinder, a physically meaningful 3-parametric trial function is used to determine the ground state energy $E$ of the system. This trial function incorporates the exact symmetries and key limiting behaviors of the problem explicitly. In particular, it does not treat the Coulomb potential nor the magnetic interaction as a perturbation. The novel inclusion of a variational cut-off factor, $(1 - (\frac{\rho}{\rho_0})^\nu )$, appears to represent an improvement compared to the non-variational cut-off factors commonly employed in the literature. A phenomenon of a sharp change of $\nu-$behavior for small magnetic fields $B \lesssim 0.45\,a.u.$ with fixed radius $\rho_0 \approx 2\,a.u.$ is indicated. The energy dependence $E=E(\rho_0,\,B)$ on the cavity radius $\rho_0 \in [0.8,\,5] \,a.u.$ and the magnetic field strength $B \in [0,\,1]\, a.u.$ is presented in detail. The expectation value $\langle \rho \rangle$ and the Shannon entropy in position space are computed to provide additional insights into the system's localization. A brief discussion is provided comparing the 2D and 3D cases as well.</description>

      <title>Whether a quantum computation employs nonlocal resources is operationally undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational complexity characterizes the usage of spatial and temporal resources by computational processes. In the classical theory of computation, e.g. in the Turing Machine model, computational processes employ only local space and time resources, and their resource usage can be accurately measured by us as users. General relativity and quantum theory, however, introduce the possibility of computational processes that employ nonlocal spatial or temporal resources. While the space and time complexity of classical computing can be given a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the case in any setting involving nonlocal resources. In such settings, theoretical analyses of resource usage cease to be reliable indicators of practical computational capability. We prove that the verifier (C) in a multiple interactive provers with shared entanglement (MIP*) protocol cannot operationally demonstrate that the "multiple" provers are independent, i.e. cannot operationally distinguish a MIP* machine from a monolithic quantum computer. Thus C cannot operationally distinguish a MIP* machine from a quantum TM, and hence cannot operationally demonstrate the solution to arbitrary problems in RE. Any claim that a MIP* machine has solved a TM-undecidable problem is, therefore, circular, as the problem of deciding whether a physical system is a MIP* machine is itself TM-undecidable. Consequently, despite the space and time complexity of classical computing having a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the case in any setting involving nonlocal resources. In such settings, theoretical analyses of resource usage cease to be reliable indicators of practical computational capability. This has practical consequences when assessing newly proposed computational frameworks based on quantum theories.</description>

      <title>From Classical to Quantum: Explicit Classical Distributions Achieving Maximal Quantum $f$-Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit classical states achieving maximal $f$-divergence are given, allowing for a simple proof of Matsumoto's Theorem, and the systematic extension of any inequality between classical $f$-divergences to quantum $f$-divergences. Our methodology is particularly simple as it does not require any elaborate matrix analysis machinery but only basic linear algebra. It is also effective, as illustrated by two examples improving existing bounds: (i)~an improved quantum Pinsker inequality is derived between $\chi^2$ and trace norm, and leveraged to improve a bound in decoherence theory; (ii)~a new reverse quantum Pinsker inequality is derived for any quantum $f$-divergence, and compared to previous (Audenaert-Eisert and Hirche-Tomamichel) bounds.</description>

      <title>Error-mitigated Geometric Quantum Control over an Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information is very fragile to environmental- and operational-induced imperfections. Therefore, the construction of practical quantum computers needs the quantum error correction technique to protect quantum information. Particularly, encode a logical qubit into the large Hilbert space of an oscillator is a hardware-efficient way of correcting quantum errors. In this strategy, selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates are vital for universal quantum control. However, the quality of SNAP gates is considerably limited by the small coupling-induced non-linearity of the oscillator. Here, to resolve this limitation, we propose a robust scheme based on quantum optimal control via the functional theory, by designing an appropriate trajectory for a target operation. Besides, we combine the geometric phase approach with our trajectory design scheme to minimize the decoherence effect, by shortening the gate-time. Numerical simulation shows that both errors can be significantly mitigated and the robustness of the geometric gate against both $X$ and $Z$ errors can be maintained. Therefore, our scheme provides a promising alternative for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the macroscopic dynamics of Josephson charge pumps in the light of Alicki et al.'s theoretical description of the Josephson junction as an open quantum system described by a Markovian master equation. If the Coulomb interaction between the terminals is taken into account, we find that the resulting description of pumping is physically reasonable and in good qualitative agreement with experimental observations. We comment on how this approach relates to other theoretical treatments of quantum pumps based on time-dependent potentials or scattering amplitudes. We also highlight the significance of our results in the broader context of the dynamics of charge pumping by active systems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Control under Physical Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control is concerned with the realisation of desired dynamics in quantum systems, serving as a linchpin for advancing quantum technologies and fundamental research. Analytic approaches and standard optimisation algorithms do not yield satisfactory solutions for large quantum systems, and especially not for real world quantum systems which are open and noisy. We devise a physics-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that restricts the space of possible solutions. We incorporate priors about the desired time scales of the quantum state dynamics - as well as realistic control signal limitations - as constraints to the RL algorithm. These physics-informed constraints additionally improve computational scalability by facilitating parallel optimisation. We evaluate our method on three broadly relevant quantum systems (multi-level $\Lambda$ system, Rydberg atom and superconducting transmon) and incorporate real-world complications, arising from dissipation and control signal perturbations. We achieve both higher fidelities - which exceed 0.999 across all systems - and better robustness to time-dependent perturbations and experimental imperfections than previous methods. Lastly, we demonstrate that incorporating multi-step feedback can yield solutions robust even to strong perturbations.</description>

      <title>Verifying Fault-Tolerance of Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have advanced rapidly in qubit number and gate fidelity. However, they would still lack practicalness without utilizing fault-tolerant quantum error correction code (QECC) implementations to suppress noise. Manually or experimentally verifying the fault-tolerance of complex QECCs is impractical due to the vast error combinations. This paper formalizes fault-tolerance within the language of quantum programs. By incorporating the techniques of quantum symbolic execution, we provide an automatic verification tool for quantum fault-tolerance. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool on a universal set of logical operations across different QECCs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis and Noise Robustness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, hybrid quantum neural networks (HQNNs) offer a promising solution, combining the strengths of classical machine learning with quantum computing capabilities. However, the performance of these networks can be significantly affected by the quantum noise inherent in NISQ devices. In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative analysis of various HQNN algorithms, namely Quantum Convolution Neural Network (QCNN), Quanvolutional Neural Network (QuanNN), and Quantum Transfer Learning (QTL), for image classification tasks. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm across quantum circuits with different entangling structures, variations in layer count, and optimal placement in the architecture. Subsequently, we select the highest-performing architectures and assess their robustness against noise influence by introducing quantum gate noise through Phase Flip, Bit Flip, Phase Damping, Amplitude Damping, and the Depolarizing Channel. Our results reveal that the top-performing models exhibit varying resilience to different noise gates. However, in most scenarios, the QuanNN demonstrates greater robustness across various quantum noise channels, consistently outperforming other models. This highlights the importance of tailoring model selection to specific noise environments in NISQ devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the probability distribution function (PDF) and full counting statistics (FCS) play a fundamental role in characterizing the fluctuations of quantum observables, as they encode the complete information about these fluctuations. In this letter, we measure these two quantities in a trapped-ion quantum simulator for the transverse and longitudinal magnetization within a subsystem. We utilize the toolbox of classical shadows to postprocess the measurements performed in random bases. The measurement scheme efficiently allows access to the FCS and PDF of all possible operators on desired choices of subsystems of an extended quantum system.</description>

      <title>Correlation strengths in hybrid networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a generic hybrid network, classical, quantum, and no-signaling sources emit local hidden variables, stabilizer states, and no-signaling systems, respectively. We investigate the maximal correlation strength as the non-classical feature in this network. Given the associated fully-quantum network of a hybrid network, we exploit the stabilizing operators of the distributed quantum state to construct segmented Bell operators and the Bell inequalities tailored to the state. We derive the upper bounds of the maximal correlation strengths in the associated full-classical, full-quantum, and fully-no-signaling networks as the benchmarks. Our study shows that the achievable correlation strength depends on the number of type-A measurements and that of nonlocal sources. We also introduce the t-nonlocality criteria, indicating that the achievable maximal correlation strength cannot modeled by the network with at least t observers with local hidden variables performing type-A measurements.</description>

      <title>Two-photon scattering in a waveguide by a giant atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-photon scattering by a two-level giant atom in a waveguide. We first study the case that the giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two coupling points, and obtain Bethe ansatz eigenstates and eigenvalues in the Hilbert space of two-excitation. Then we derive bound states by subtracting the states corresponding to Bethe ansatz solutions from the entire two-excitation Hilbert space, and construct the two-photon scattering matrix (S-matrix) by using Bethe ansatz eigenstates and bound states. We further study the properties of output states, which include both the scattering and bound states, for arbitrarily incident two-photon states by using a concrete example. We find that the oscillation period of the scattering states and decay rates of the bound states strongly depend on the distance between two coupling points. Moreover, we find that the two-photon correlation in the bound states can be enhanced by changing such distance when the total energy of two incident photons equals to two times of single photon resonance energy. We also generalize our study to the case that the giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via $N$ coupling points. We obtain all the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the scattering matrix and construct the S-matrix. Comparing with the case of the two coupling points, we find the photon correlation can be further enhanced by increasing the number of the coupling points for the same incident states when the distance of any two nearest neighbor coupling points is half of the wavelength.</description>

      <title>Quantifying entanglement dimensionality from the quantum Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is known to be an essential resource for a number of tasks, including quantum-enhanced metrology, and can thus be quantified by figures of merit related to those tasks. In quantum metrology this is emphasized by the connections between the quantum Fisher information (QFI), providing the ultimate bounds of precision, and multipartite entanglement quantifiers such as the depth of entanglement. In systems composed by many qudits, it is also important to characterize the dimensionality of entanglement across bipartitions, i.e., loosely speaking, the minimal number of levels that must be entangled with each other in a given bipartition. However, the impact of high-dimensional entanglement on the QFI remains unexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by deriving a quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) criterion for witnessing the entanglement dimensionality across bipartitions, along with scalar corollaries, which we also extend to the multipartite scenario. To further emphasize the significance of our results, we draw connections with the precision of multiparameter estimation, which also provides a practical way of implementing our methods in experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Spectral Response of linear-quadratic optomechanical interaction: Effects of pure dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, the decoherence dynamics and spectral response of an optomechanical system, with linear and quadratic couplings, is addressed. The decoherence considered arises from pure dephasing, described by the Milburn stochastic evolution of the Schr\"odinger equation. In the first part of the manuscript, it is shown how the decoherence rate influences the evolution of the number of phonons, and the quadrature of the mechanical resonator. In the second part of the manuscript, an attempt to look at the spectral response of the mechanical part of the system is given using non-stationary spectroscopy. It is emphasized the response of the resonator in its equilibrium position when a single photon excitation in the cavity field is prepared. Coherent states are also considered in the cavity field and the mechanical resonator. Results and discussion comparing the inclusions of the linear, quadratic, and linear-quadratic couplings are given.</description>

      <title>End-to-end workflow for machine learning-based qubit readout with QICK and hls4ml</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end workflow for superconducting qubit readout that embeds co-designed Neural Networks (NNs) into the Quantum Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK). Capitalizing on the custom firmware and software of the QICK platform, which is built on Xilinx RFSoC FPGAs, we aim to leverage machine learning (ML) to address critical challenges in qubit readout accuracy and scalability. The workflow utilizes the hls4ml package and employs quantization-aware training to translate ML models into hardware-efficient FPGA implementations via user-friendly Python APIs. We experimentally demonstrate the design, optimization, and integration of an ML algorithm for single transmon qubit readout, achieving 96% single-shot fidelity with a latency of 32ns and less than 16% FPGA look-up table resource utilization. Our results offer the community an accessible workflow to advance ML-driven readout and adaptive control in quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Weak convexity of Fisher information matrix and superresolved localization of blinking sources of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group of techniques known by the general name of single-molecule localization microscopy reaches a nanometer-scale spatial resolution of point light emitters, well below the diffraction limit of the traditional microscopy. The key feature of these techniques is blinking, alternation of bright and dark states, of each emitter so that no more than one emitter is bright within the width of the point-spread function of microscope during a time sufficient for its localization. We give a formulation of the optical part of these techniques in terms of quantum metrology, where the limit of precision is determined by the Fisher information on the emitters positions contained in the measurement data. We show that the advantage in resolution provided by making the emitters to blink is a consequence of the fundamental property of Fisher information, its convexity. In particular, we prove the weak matrix convexity and the trace convexity of the Fisher information matrix -- two fundamental results in the multiparameter estimation theory. We show also that the advantage in information is inherent to the quantum state of light itself before the measurement and is related to the convexity of the quantum Fisher information matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) focuses on determining conflict-free paths for multiple agents navigating through a shared space to reach specified goal locations. This problem becomes computationally challenging, particularly when handling large numbers of agents, as frequently encountered in practical applications like coordinating autonomous vehicles. Quantum computing (QC) is a promising candidate in overcoming such limits. However, current quantum hardware is still in its infancy and thus limited in terms of computing power and error robustness. In this work, we present the first optimal hybrid quantum-classical MAPF algorithm which is based on branch-and-cut-and-prize. QC is integrated by iteratively solving QUBO problems, based on conflict graphs. Experiments on actual quantum hardware and results on benchmark data suggest that our approach dominates previous QUBO formulations and baseline MAPF solvers.</description>
